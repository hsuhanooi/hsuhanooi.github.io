My name is Hsu Han Ooi and I'm a web developer and tech-entrepreneur. I've lived in Seattle since 2007 and graduated from UW with a BS in Computer Science. Since then I've worked at various startups throughout the Seattle area and continue to be excited by the burgeoning Seattle technology community.

## Current Projects

I currently hack away at [Madrona Venture Labs](http://madronavl.com/) a ([startup studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_studio)) in Seattle, WA.
